<H1> <cite>C2Ada</cite> - a translator from C to Ada </H1>

<B>New!</b> <i><a href="#releases">Beta 3 release</a></i>, 10 April
1996. (<a href="ftp:c2ada.tar.gz">Download</a>)
-->

<p>
<cite>C2Ada</cite> is a translator from the C programming language to
the
<A HREF="http://www.adaic.org/"> Ada 95 </A>
programming language.
It is written in C and is hosted on Unix. (We are aware of an OS/2 port.)

<p>
<cite>C2Ada</cite> was used by Intermetrics to produce Ada 95
bindings to X Windows, Microsoft Windows, and GCCS.

<p>Using <cite>C2Ada</cite> is a way to lessen the work in translating C headers
into Ada, to produce a <b>binding</b>, and in translating whole
C programs into Ada, producing a <b>translation</b>.  <cite>C2Ada</cite> can
do about 80% to 90% of the work automatically but it still takes
some manual work to do the last 10% or 20%.

<p>The technology for translating C headers is more mature than
the technology for translating C functions and statments.
<cite>C2Ada</cite> does not translate C++, just C.

<h1> Using <cite>C2Ada</cite> </h1>

<P> The simplest use of the command is

<pre>
c2ada test1.c
</pre>

(<cite>test1.c</cite> is not the name of a file in the distribution.)
With no command line options, this command translates the source
<cite>test1.c</cite> into the Ada files
<cite>bindings/test1.ads</cite>
and <cite>bindings/test1.adb</cite>.

<P> It uses <cite>C</cite> as the name of the "predefined" or "parent"
package. (See further discussion below.)  Comments are not retained,
no package filename map or configuration file is used.

<P> If <cite>test1.c</cite> contains any <code>#include</code>
statements, then Ada files will be generated as well for the included
C files.

<h2> Command line options </h2>

<p>
Running the command <code>c2ada</code> with no arguments will print a
full list of the options available.

<P>
The most important command line options are:

<dl>
<dt> <code>-D<var>name</var>[=<var>value</var>]</code>
<dd>
		Define a macro with an optional value.  By default
			macros will be defined with the value 1.

<dt> <code>-I<var>dir</var></code>
<dd>
		Add a search path for finding include files.

<dt> <code>-S<var>dir</var></code>
<dd>		Add a search path for system include files

<dt>	<code>-C</code>
<dd>		Attempt to retain C comments in the translation.

<dt>	<code>-pp <var>name</var> </code>
<dd>		Predefined (or parent) package name (default is <cite>C</cite>)

<dt>	<code>-mf</code>
<dd>		Use file <cite>cbind.map</cite> to map unit names.

<dt>	<code>-P<var>filename</var></code>
<dd>		configuration file name

<dt>	<code>-O<var>pathname</var></code>
<dd>		output directory (default=<cite>bindings</cite>)

</dl>


<h2> Example usage </h2>

When using <cite>C2Ada</cite> to produce the GCCS binding/translation,
this command script was used:

<pre>
#!/bin/sh

# -C:		 Preserve comments
# -pp:		 parent package = gccs
# -sih:          Suppress import declarations from included headers.
# -src:          Suppress all record rep clauses.
# -ap:           Automatic packaging.
# -gnat and -95: Select gnat and Ada 95
# -mwarn:        Warnings about untranslated macros.
# -mf:		 use <cite>cbind.map</cite> file for package name mappings
# -noref:	 no reference comments back to C
# -I.:		 process #includes from this directory

I="-Igccs/ -Igccs/AcctGrps/"
P="-Pconfig-gccs"
PP="-pp gccs"

$c2ada/c2ada -C $P $PP -sih -src -ap -gnat -95 -mwarn -mf $I test.h
</pre>

The <cite>c2ada</cite> command is run from the Unix command line with a series
of switches, mentioned above, on the file <cite>test.h</cite>.  This file
<cite>test.h</cite>
was written to have a series of C <code>#define</code> and
<code>#include</code> statements
which cause the right constants to be set for the binding, and
cause the right files to be brought into the binding. <p>


<h3> Parent package </h3>

The <code>-pp gccs</code> switch says that the "parent package" of most other
packages will be named <code>gccs</code>.
(Using GNAT conventions, the package's
Ada name is <code>package gccs</code>, the file <cite>gccs.ads</cite> contains
its specification, and the file <cite>gccs.adb</cite>
contains its body.)  If no <code>-pp</code> command line
option is given the default is a package named <code>C</code>
in file <cite>c.ads</cite>.

<p>Another gloss of the <code>-pp</code> switch is that it defines
the "predefined package".  The translation relies on a number of
predefined types and subroutines. (Many of these declarations are
simply renamings of facilities in <cite>Interfaces.C</cite>.)
The distribution includes files
<cite>c.ads</cite>,
<cite>c.adb</cite>,
<cite>c-ops.ads</cite>,
and
<cite>c-ops.adb</cite>
which contain these definitions. These names reflect the default
predefined package name <cite>C</cite>.  The user can make modified
copies of these files to define a parent package for a particular
C-to-Ada translation project.


<h3> Ada 95 package hierarchy </h3>

A useful feature of Ada 95 is parent-child package hierarchies.
<cite>C2Ada</cite> translates Unix directory hierarchies into
Ada 95 parent-child library hierarchies.
If a C source file contains the lines

<code><pre>
#include "name1.h"
#include "gccs/name2.h"
#include "gccs/name3.h"
</pre></code>

and the parent package is set to gccs, the Ada package names
that will be generated are

<pre>
package name1;
package gccs.name2;
package gccs.name3;
</pre>

Directories can be nested to any level, causing an equivalent
nesting of Ada parent and child libraries.

<h3> The <cite>cbind.map</cite> file </h3>
If additional control is needed over the package names that
are generated, the <code>-mf</code> command line option can be used causing
the file <cite>cbind.map</cite> to change package name mappings.
This file contains lines with 4 entries per line, separated
by whitespace:

<pre>
gccs/string.h StringPkg stringpkg.ads stringpkg.adb
</pre>

This line says that a C <code>#include</code> file <cite>gccs/string.h</cite>
will be mapped into Ada name "package StringPkg", and the Ada
code that is generated will go into files <cite>stringpkg.ads</cite>
and <cite>stringpkg.adb</cite>. <p>

<a name="env-vars"></a>
<h3> The <cite>C2ADA_PYTHONPATH</cite> environment variable </h3>

<cite>C2Ada</cite> requires no environment variables to be set.  The
build procedure predefines a path along which to find the required
Python modules.  These modules fall into two categories and two
corresponding directories:

<ol>

<li><i>source</i> modules: modules written specifically as integral
    parts of <cite>C2Ada</cite>.  These are in the source directory.

<li><i>library</i> modules: these are modules distributed with the
    Python language system.

</ol>

<p>
If you have any reason to override the default path, you can define
the environment variable <cite>C2ADA_PYTHONPATH</cite>.  It must
include the directories that contain the source and library modules.

<h2> Translating C Preprocessor Macros </h2>

<cite>C2Ada</cite> can automatically translate some C macros into Ada
but it has a hard time with some others.  There are two ways to get
good translations of macros.  One is
<a href="#macros"> Configuring C Macro Translations</a>.
The other is explained here.
The idea is to change the C source to use C++ inline function syntax.
For example

<pre>
#define max(a,b) ((a)>=(b)?(a):(b))
</pre>

can be changed in the C source to

<pre>
inline int max(int a,int b) {return ((a)>=(b)?(a):(b));}
</pre>

(presuming that the user decides the parameters and result
are all of type "int".)
This will then produce an Ada specification:

<pre>
function max (a, b: integer) return integer;
pragma inline(max);
</pre>

... and a body for max, in the Ada package body, that does the right thing.
<cite>C2Ada</cite> cannot guess the types of the parameters and
the type of the function result but if this information is supplied
by the user <cite>C2Ada</cite> can do the rest. <p>

<h2>Other options </h2>

Typing the command <code>c2ada</code> with no options causes it to
print a full list of its options.

<hr>
<a name="mainprog"> </a>
<H1>Generating a main program</h1>

<P>
If you're translating a complete C program, the source directory
contains a utility program to write an Ada main procedure to call the
translated C main procedure.  The program is <cite>AdaMain.py</cite>,
a Python script. The command line is:

<pre>
python Adamain.py <var>cmain</var> <var>predef</var> <var>unit</var> <var>[filename]</var>
</pre>

where

<cite>cmain</cite> is the name of Ada unit containing the translated
C <cite>main()</cite>;

<cite>predef</cite> is the name of the predefined Ada package;

<cite>unit</cite> is the name of the output compilation unit
(an Ada procedure);

<cite>filename</cite> is the pathname to which the unit is written --
if <cite>filename</cite> is omitted, then output appears on
<cite>stdout</cite>.

<hr>
<a name="configuration"> </a>
<H1>Configuration</h1>

<P>The <cite>C2Ada</cite> translator is able to translate most C
constructs into equivalent Ada constructs. In some cases, however, the
information in the C source is inadequate to suggest the proper
action, or several translations are possible, or the translator simply
needs a hint about what to do.  Most of this information is specific
to the corpus of code being translated.

<P>Specifying this additional information to the translator is the
role of the <dfn>configuration file</dfn>.  This file contains a
series of statements relevant to the overall translation, to
particular source files, and to particular C declarations and macros.
<cite>C2Ada</cite> interprets these statements to build a data
structure which guides the translation process.  Hence configuration
information about particular entities does not need to be presented in
any particular order.

<P>Using the configuration file (rather than just editing the output
Ada code) may be of particular benefit if you're tracking revisions of
a C source.  Since the configuration file identifies constructs by
name, and the names of most existing constructs don't change from
version to version, most of the changes you specify can be
automatically performed for the new version.

<P>The configuration file facility is implemented using the programming
language <A HREF=http://www.python.org><cite>Python</cite></A>.
Python is a simple yet powerful object-oriented
language whose syntax and semantics (and the fact that it can be
embedded in C!) make it quite suitable for use as a scripting
language.  The configuration file is in fact a series of Python
statements which are interpreted in an environment that defines
useful objects and classes.

<P>(These objects and classes are defined in the Python source file
<cite>C2ada.py</cite>.)

<P> A knowlege of Python isn't necessary to read and write a
configuration file, however.  As new syntactic constructs are used in
the examples which follow, a brief discussion of the syntax appears
like this:

<blockquote>
(Blank lines and whitespace may be used freely. A comment starts with
the character # and ends at the end of line.)
</blockquote>

<P> The name of the configuration file is specified by using the
<code>-P</code> command line switch.

<h2>Specifying the configuration</h2>

<P>Statements in the configuration file which place information in the
configuration data structure must reference the single
<em>configuration object</em>.  The expression which denotes this
object is <code>the</code>.

<blockquote>
(Case is significant in identifiers.)
</blockquote>

<P> The attributes of this object are:

<dl>

<dt><code>reserved_names</code>

<dd>A list of names to be avoided in naming Ada declarations. The names
in this list are typically the names of Ada units which might conflict
with symbol names.

<dt><code>source</code>

<dd>A method which maps C source file names to the object representing
that source file.

</dl>

<h3>Configuring reserved names</h3>

Assigning a list of names to <cite>the.reserved_names</cite>
configures those names as reserved names.

For example, a project using X Windows is apt to have <cite>X</cite>
as the name of a parent package. To allow direct used of qualified names
referring to any X Windows symbols, the translator should avoid
assigning the name <cite>X</cite> to any local entities. The
declaration to do this is

<pre>
the.reserved_names = ['X']
</pre>

<blockquote>
(The dot notation selects an attribute or method of an object. The
equal sign is assignment. Brackets enclose a comma-separated list --
here the list is one item long.  Single or double quotes enclose
string literals. A statement ends at logical end-of-line, which is the
physical end-of-line unless the last character on the line is
backslash (\). )
</blockquote>

<h3>Specifying a source file</h3>

The expression to specify the source file <cite>whatever.c</cite> is

<pre>
the.source('whatever.c')
</pre>

or, equivalently,

<pre>
the.source("whatever.c")
</pre>

<blockquote>
(Methods are invoked by enclosing the comma-separated argument list in
parentheses.)
</blockquote>

<p>This construct always designates the same <cite>C_source</cite>
object, which is created the first time the file name is used in this
construct.

<p>In this version of <cite>C2Ada</cite>,
the argument to <cite>the.source</cite> must be the pathname of the file
exactly as it is used to open the file.  For instance, if the C source
contains the include directive

<pre>
#include "header.h"
</pre>

and <cite>C2Ada</cite> finds <cite>header.h</cite> in the directory
<cite>dir</cite>, then the expression to designate the corresponding
object is

<pre>
the.source('dir/header.h')
</pre>


<h2><em>C_source</em> objects</h2>

<P>A <em>C_source</em> object holds information about the translation
of a C source file, and about the translation of declarations and
macros within that file.  The attributes and methods are:

<dl>

<dt><code>decl</code>

<dd> A method that maps a C identifier into an object (of class
<cite>Decl</cite> holding configuration information about the
translation of the denoted C construct.

<dt><code>macro</code>

<dd>A method that maps a C preprocessing identifier for a macro into
an object (of class <cite>Macro</cite>) holding configuration
information about the denoted macro.

<dt><code>interfaces(<var>filename</var>)</code>

<dd>The source should be a <cite>.h</cite> file: then
<cite>filename</cite> should be the <cite>.c</cite> file which it
interfaces.

<dt><code>unchecked_conversions_to_spec</code>

<dd>A boolean attribute that specifies whether the unchecked
conversions which are generated in the body should be declared in the
Ada package's spec rather than body.
<em>[TBD: This attribute is no longer necessary?]</em>

</dl>

<h3>Configuring C modules</h3>

<P>A common style in C code is to write a module as a file
<code>whatever.c</code>, then write an interface for that module as an
include file <code>whatever.h</code>.  (Of course, nothing in C
requires, or particularly supports, doing things this way.)

<p>To specify that a <cite>.h</cite> and <cite>.c</cite> file are
related, use a command like this:

<pre>
the.source('whatever.h').interfaces('whatever.c')
</pre>

<h3>Specifying a C declaration </h3>

A C declaration is specified in an expression like this:

<pre>
the.source('whatever.h').decl('whichever')
</pre>

<p>In this example, <cite>whichever</cite> is the name of a C entity
declared in the file <cite>whatever.h</cite>.

<p> A C struct type with tag <cite>whatever</cite> can be specified in
an expression like this:

<pre>
the.source('whatever.h').decl('struct whatever')
</pre>

<h3>Specifying a C macro </h3>

<p>A C macro is specified by indicating its source file and its name in
an expression like this:

<pre>
the.source('whatever.h').macro('WHICHEVER')
</pre>

<h2>Configuring C Declarations</h2>

<p>The attributes and methods associated with a C declaration (class
<cite>Decl</cite>) are:

<dl>

<dt><code>ada_name</code>

<dd>The Ada name to use for the equivalent symbol in the translation;
overrides the default generated name.

<dt><code>return_type_is_void</code>

<dd>A boolean which specifies whether the declaration (expected to be
a function without an explicit type in C) should be translated into a
procedure rather than a function returning int.

<dt> <code>private</code>

<dd> A boolean specifying whether the declaration (expected to be a
pointer type or an incomplete struct type) is to be translated into an
Ada private type.

<dt> <code>declare_in_spec</code>

<dd> A boolean specifying whether the declaration (expected to be a
external function definition in a <cite>.c</cite> source file) is to
be declared in the package specification, as well as the package body,
of the resulting package.

</dl>

<h3>Configuring a private type</h3>

<p>A C idiom for an opaque or private type is a pointer to an incomplete
struct. Typically the type is used or typedef'd in an include file
that serves as a module interface, and the struct is actually
defined in the source file serving as the module body. For instance,
the include file <cite>whatever.h</cite> may contain

<pre>
typedef struct example * Handle;
</pre>

but with no definition of <cite>struct example</cite>. The
straightforward Ada translation into a package specification,

<pre>
    type struct_example;
    type struct_example_access is access all struct_example;
    subtype Handle is struct_example_access;
</pre>

is unsatisfactory because these declarations are only valid if there's
a definition of <cite>struct_example</cite> in the public part of the
package spec.

<p>Adding these statements to the configuration file:

<pre>
the.source('whatever.h').decl('struct example').private = True
the.source('whatever.h').decl('Handle') = True
</pre>

<blockquote>
(True and False are predefined.)
</blockquote>

causes the translation to be:

<pre>
-- (in public part of spec)

    type struct_example_access is private;
    type null_struct_example_access : constant struct_example_access;

    type Handle is private;
    null_Handle : constant Handle;

private

    type Struct_example;
    type Struct_example_access is access all struct_example;
    null_struct_blah_access : constant struct_blah_access := null;

    type Handle is access all struct_example;
    null_Handle : constant Handle := null;

</pre>

<p>The configuration statement for <cite>struct example</cite> causes
the equivalent Ada type, <cite>struct_example</cite> to be declared in
the private part, and an access-to-object type for this type to be
declared private in the the public part, then defined in the private
part.  In addition, the name for the null value of this pointer type
is declared.

<p>Similarly, the configuration statement for <cite>Handle</cite>
causes a private type, and a null value for the access type, to be
declared; the private part contains the requisite declarations and
definitions.

<h3>Configuring visible function declarations</h3>

<p>In C, an external function definition is implicitly visible in
parts of the program outside the source file it is defined in, whether
the call site has an explicit declaration visible or not.

<p>The default translation performed by <cite>C2Ada</cite> makes no
externally visible declaration of such a function, unless there's a C
declaration of the function in an include file, and that include file
is configured with an <decl>interfaces</decl> statement.

<p>The <cite>declare_in_spec</cite> attribute of a <cite>Decl</cite>
object is used to override this default behavior.  If the function
<cite>func</cite> is defined in the source file
<cite>whatever.c</cite>, then a statement like this will cause a
declaration of the function to be placed in the resulting Ada package
spec:

<pre>
the.source('whatever.c').decl('func').declare_in_spec = True
</pre>

<a name="macros"> </a>
<H2>Configuring C Macro Translations</h2>

Specifying a C macro in the configuration file indicates an intention
to replace the macro's <code>#define</code> directive with a C declaration.
the attribute(s) specified for the macro determine how to rewrite the
<code>#define</code> directive as a C declaration.

This facility for configuring macro rewrites currently provides no
capabilities that couldn't be achieved by modifying the source
file. (Note, however

<p>The attributes and methods associated with a C macro (class
<cite>Macro</cite>) are:

<dl>

<dt><code>replacement</code>

<dd>The text which should completely replace the <code>#define</code>
directive:
the preprocessor deletes the <code>#define</code> directive and forwards the
replacement text to the C parser.

<p>If the <cite>replacement</cite> attribute is specified,
<cite>C2Ada</cite> does not examine any other attributes.

<dt><code>signature</code>

<dd>Specifies the argument list of the inline function which will
replace the macro definition.

<dt><code>returns</code>

<dd>The type returned by the function which will replace the macro
definition; if unspecified, the function will have <cite>void</cite>
return type.

</dl>

<h3>Configuring a function-like macro</h3>

<p>Say the C source file <cite>whatever.h</cite> contains a macro like
this:

<pre>
#define AccessCount(x) ((x)->hits)
</pre>

<p> There is little that <cite>C2Ada</cite> can do to translate this
into a function. (In fact what it does is perform C-preprocessor expansion
at any call site.)  It is not clear from examining the definition what
the type of <cite>x</cite>, or what the type of the resulting
expression.

<p> But the user may know that <cite>x</cite> is always a pointer to
an object of type <cite>struct info</cite>, and that the
<cite>hits</cite> field of this record has type <cite>short
int</cite>.  The user could then declare <cite>signature</cite> and
<cite>returns</cite> attributes that provide <cite>C2Ada</cite> with
enough information to transform the definition into a declaration:


<pre>
ac = the.source('whatever.h').macro('AccessCount')
ac.signature = 'struct info * x'
ac.returns   = 'short int'
</pre>

<blockquote>
(The first statement, for convenience, assigns the
<cite>Macro</cite> object to the local variable <cite>ac</cite>; this
variable requires no declaration.)
</blockquote>

<cite>C2Ada</cite> then rewrites the declaration as:

<pre>
inline short int AccessCount(struct info * x) { return (x)->count; }
</pre>

<p>
<code>inline</code> is a special extension to the ANSI C syntax
accepted by <cite>C2Ada</cite> to tag functions whose translations
should be given a <cite>pragma Inline</cite> declaration in Ada.

<hr>
<a name="restrictions"> </a>
<H1>Restrictions</h1>

<h2>Environment restrictions</h2>

<p>The <cite>C2Ada</cite> code was developed on SunOs 4.1.3 using the
Gnu C compiler <cite>gcc</cite>.
(In principle, there's no reason to think that the code
can't be built and run in other environments.)

<p><cite>C2Ada</cite> is written using ANSI C, so it cannot
be built with an old K&R C compiler like the one that comes
with SunOS.

<P>The translator generally produces portable Ada 95 code, relying for
the most part only on the additional facilities of the
<cite>Interfaces.C</cite> package.  But in some places,
<cite>C2Ada</cite> assumes that the target Ada compiler is GNAT, the
GNU Ada compiler. Features specific to GNAT incorporated in the
translation are:

<ul>

<li>The attribute <code>'unrestricted_access</code>.

<li>The pragma <code>Unchecked_Union</code>. Note that as of this
writing, this feature has only been implemented in GNAT on Intel platforms.
This affects any C source code containing unions.

<li>Generated files have extension <cite>.ads</cite> for package specs
and <cite>.adb</cite> for package bodies.

</ul>

<h2>C Source Code Restrictions</h2>

<h3>ANSI/ISO C</h3>

<p>
<cite>C2Ada</cite> assumes that the C source code can be compiled by
a compiler that conforms to the ANSI/ISO standard for the C language.

<P><cite>C2Ada</cite> supports as an extension the keyword
<cite>inline</cite>.  C code which contains this word as an identifier
must be modified.

<P><cite>C2Ada</cite> supports C "/* ... */" comments and also
C++ "//" comments.

<h3> No function declarations without arguments </h3>

<P>In C, a function may be declared without specifying the number or
types of its arguments. There is no corresponding construct in Ada
(and a good thing, too).  <cite>C2Ada</cite> will translate such a
construct (and emit a warning), and assume that there's a 0-length
argument list, but this assumption is usually wrong.

<h3> No circular dependencies </h3>

Suppose we have C files <cite>a.h</cite> and <cite>a.c</cite> that
implement a module <cite>A</cite>, and files <cite>b.h</cite> and
<cite>b.c</cite> that implement a module <cite>B</cite>. It is quite
possible for <cite>b.c</cite> to include <cite>a.h</cite>, and
<cite>a.c</cite> to include <cite>b.h</cite>.

<P>We cannot translate these files to the spec and body for packages
<cite>A</cite> and <cite>B</cite>, however: the rules of Ada simply do
not allow it.

<H2> Bugs, Inelegant Translations,  and Unimplemented Features </h2>

<ul>

<li>Array bound expressions are evaluated, and the result of the
evaluation used as the Ada bound, rather than being translated
symbolically.

<li>A <code>sizeof</code> operator in an array size expression will
lead to the generation of an absurd Ada array bound. For instance,

<pre>
int a[] = {1,3,5,7,9,11};
int b[sizeof (a) / sizeof(int)];
</pre>

The bounds for <cite>B</cite> will be incorrect.

<li>If an array type shows up in one of a set of C files being
translated together, then other output Ada files will reference that
type definition rather than redefining the type.

<li>Certain instances of C <code>goto</code> statements
may translate into incorrect Ada because in C a program is
allowed to <code>goto</code> a label that is inside a
compound statement, and in Ada this is not allowed.

<li><cite>C2Ada</cite> attempts to recognize and automatically
translate function-like macros that are simple alterations of calls to
declared functions.  However, these alterations are text-based, so
incorrect output Ada may be generated. For instance,

<pre>
#define F(x,y)  f((int)x, (int)y)
</pre>

will produce incorrect (malformed) Ada code.

<li>The <cite>declare_in_spec</cite> configuration statement does not
cause the requisite anonymous types to be declared in the Ada spec.

<li>Volatile C types are not translated into volatile Ada types.

<li>The <cite>sizeof</cite> operator in C is always translated into an
    Ada construct that returns the size of the translated Ada object.
    An Ada array is larger than the C array from which it was
    translated, however, since it includes dimension information.
    Thus the not uncommon C construct of dividing the size of a array
    by the size of an array element will not yield the proper element
    count.

<h2> Release notes </h2>

<h3>Current release notes</h3>

At present (7 June 2011) there is no formal release
at <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/c2ada/files/">Sourceforge</a>.
Please check out from Subversion:
<pre>
   svn co https://c2ada.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/c2ada/trunk c2ada
</pre>

<h3>Old release notes</h3>

The current release is the third beta release.  Beta releases can
be identified by examining the <cite>catalog.des</cite> file in the
release. The first line of that file contains a <cite>Revision</cite>
field.  The first beta was Revision 1.135; second, 1.136; third,
1.138.

<p>
Beta 3 corrects these problems:

<ul>

<li>All Ada declarations which translate an external variable
definition in a ".c" file are now accompanied by an Export pragma.
The absence of this pragma caused problems with cross-module
references that relied on linker names (such as a reference in a C
module to a variable declared in an Ada module that was translated
from C.)

<li>An incomplete record (struct or union) type in a C file that is
completed by a definition in a later module now results in references
to the definition.  (Prior to this fix, the definition was moved to
the module with the incomplete record.)

<li>The code is somewhat more portable.  In particular, the code
now uses the standard string functions <cite>strchr</cite> and
<cite>strrchr</cite> rather than the older names <cite>index</cite>
and <cite>rindex</cite>.

<li>The Makefile now contains no hardwired references to the Python
directory in the dependencies.

</ul>

<p>
Beta 2 fixed a problem with hardwired pathnames.

The initial beta release of <cite>C2Ada</cite> had a hardwired
pathname in the file <cite>symset.c</cite>.  The simplest way to
correct this problem (aside from picking up the current release) is
to edit <cite>Makefile</cite>, delete <cite>symset.o</cite>, and
re-make.  The required edit is to change the line

<pre>
PYTHON_SCRIPTS_PATH = $(HERE)
</pre>

to

<pre>
PYTHON_SCRIPTS_PATH = $(HERE):$(PYTHON)/Lib
</pre>

<p>
Aside from fixing the problem described
above, Beta 2 added the optional <a href="#env-vars">
<cite>C2ADA_PYTHONPATH</cite></a>
environment variable.
